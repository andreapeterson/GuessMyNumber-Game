# GuessMyNumber-Game
A fun (yet sometimes annoying) game of guessing the number that Python chooses randomly with a range of 1-100. I combined the def() functions and played around with while loops and if/elif/else statements to make this game! Enjoy! Try Easy or Hard mode(different number of attempts)
